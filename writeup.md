# Educational Tutor Chatbot with Sentiment Analysis

This project develops an **Educational Tutor Chatbot** that adapts its explanations based on the user's emotional state. Utilizing the Llama 2 model for generating responses and a sentiment analysis model from Hugging Face, the chatbot personalizes its teaching style depending on whether the user is feeling frustrated or satisfied. When detecting **negative sentiment** (e.g., frustration), the bot provides simpler explanations, additional examples, or resources to support learning. For **positive sentiment** responses, the chatbot offers more detailed and challenging explanations to foster deeper understanding. The goal is to create a more engaging and responsive learning environment, helping users stay motivated and succeed in their educational journey.
